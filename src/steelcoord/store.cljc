  "SSoT for the ISCO-08 7214 structural metal preparers and erectors
  job-site scheduling/logistics coordination actor (itonami actor
  pattern, ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section; README's
  'Robotics premise' — a job-site scheduling/logistics coordination
  robot proposes crew/crane scheduling, work-record logging,
  safety-concern flags and structural-steel-materials order
  coordination under this advisor/governor pair, which never
  dispatches hardware itself, never performs structural-steel
  erection work, and never finalizes a structural-steel-erection-
  execution decision, authorizes a crane lift, or overrides a
  site-safety officer's judgment). Modeled on
  cloud-itonami-isco-7121's roofcoord.store.

  Domain:

    site    — a registered structural-steel job site (:site-id,
              :name, :address).
    worker  — a registered crew member {:worker-id :site-id :name
              :role}, belonging to exactly one registered site.
    record  — a committed operating record (a logged work record,
              scheduling proposal, safety-concern flag or supply-order
              coordination entry) — written ONLY via commit-record!.
              This actor coordinates job-site scheduling/logistics
              ONLY — a `record` is a coordination artifact, never a
              structural-steel-erection-execution act, a crane-lift
              authorization, or a site-safety-officer-judgment
              override.
